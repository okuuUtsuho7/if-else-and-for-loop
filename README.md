# if-else-and-for-loop

This C++ program is an interactive text-based application that allows the user to input their name and then presents different scenarios and responses based on the input. Let's break down how it works:

1. The program begins by including the necessary header files (`iostream` and `string`) and declaring the `using namespace std;` directive for easier use of standard input and output functions.

2. It declares several string variables for storing user input and choices: `username`, `nuke_confirm`, `nuke_confirm2`, `nuke_code`, `nuke_target`, `scarlet`, and `hey_mister`.

3. The program prompts the user to enter their name by displaying the message: "Enter your name: " and reads the input into the `username` variable using `cin`.

4. It checks the value of `username` using conditional statements:

   - If the user's name is "Vadim" or "vadim," it enters an infinite loop that continuously outputs "VADIM BLYAT!" to the console. The loop is created using `for(;;)`.

   - If the user's name is "Utsuho" or "utsuho," it proceeds to another set of conditions:
     - It greets the user as "Mr. Utsuho / Reiuji Utsuho."
     - Asks whether to launch a nuclear missile and reads the input into `nuke_confirm`.
     - If `nuke_confirm` is "y" or "yes," it asks for a nuclear passcode and proceeds based on the input. The user has the option to set a target and launch a missile.
     - If `nuke_confirm` is "n" or "no," it simply says "Have a good day."

   - If the user's name is "Myon," "myon," or "Youmu," it displays "Hug Myon!"

   - If the user's name is "Remilia," "remilia," "mistr00s," or "remi," it enters another set of conditions:
     - It greets the user as "Remilia Scarlet."
     - Asks whether to cover the sky with Scarlet Mist and reads the input into `scarlet`.
     - If `scarlet` is "y" or "yes," it asks for a passcode (presumably a reference to a doujin). Otherwise, it will just greet you.
     - If the correct passcode is entered, it covers the sky with Scarlet Mist, allowing the user to go outside without a parasol.
     - If the passcode is incorrect, it displays "Incorrect passcode."

   - For any other user names, it displays a simple greeting: "Hello [username]."

5. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution and terminates.

This program demonstrates the use of conditional statements (`if-else`) and input/output with user interactions based on the input provided. It is designed to have fun interactions and responses for different user names and choices.
